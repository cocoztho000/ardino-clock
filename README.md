# ardino-clock
Code behind an Arduino clock using an Arduino Nano and 8 shift registers

## Steps to build the clock
1. Sand and laminate board
2. Drill holes and pour epoxy
3. sand and drill led wholes
4. wire all ground wires
5. wire all positive wires
6. load the code to the Arduino
7. doneskies

## Things to note for the next build
1. Start the circuit at the 1st hour and minute hand
2. Use the shift registers for all leds, don't put some leds on the Arduino
3. Buy shift registers already mounted to boards to simplify the wirelayout
4. Solder the led wires from the bottom up to have better wire management
5. When pouring epoxy cover the back of all the wholes with silicone so none leaks through and accidently glues your board to the table
